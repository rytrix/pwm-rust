drag drop vaults

is it possible to refactor changed into vault directly instead of in the wrapper? (will break serialization, so if I do this I also want to implement encryption/hashing options)

Not in my scope because I don't personally need or want these
* folders/categories
* notes?

Good defaults are a priority, these are not important to me 
* options for strength of hashes (and maybe a benchmark for how long it'll take to hash)
* options for which encryption method to use

more options for password generation (such as allowed characters and maybe entrophy)

maybe just give a warning if the password strength is below an acceptable threshold when creating a vault/saving passwords

importing very large csv freezes gui, maybe buffer the db? or keep track of the previous state

drag drop vaults

is it possible to refactor changed into vault directly instead of in the wrapper?

save recently opened files
ask to load recently opened file

options for strength of hashes (and maybe a benchmark for how long it'll take to hash)
options for which encryption method to use

more options for password generation (such as allowed characters and maybe entrophy)

automatic saving?

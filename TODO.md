# Bugs
?Can't close if file manager is open

# Todo
importing very large csv freezes gui, maybe buffer the db? or keep track of the previous state

drag drop vaults

is it possible to refactor changed into vault directly instead of in the wrapper?

option to forget recent vaults
?confirm displayed vaults exist?

options for strength of hashes (and maybe a benchmark for how long it'll take to hash)
options for which encryption method to use

more options for password generation (such as allowed characters and maybe entrophy)

potential secret key file for additional security?

?maybe I should just use gtk (or improve the file menu to look more "native")
custom buttons would be nice or better appearance

# Todo
importing very large csv shows updating vault for a long time, maybe buffer the db? or keep track of the previous state
cache parts? of previous state of vault for when it is updating?

drag drop vaults

is it possible to refactor changed into vault directly instead of in the wrapper?

I don't even know if this in my scope because I don't personally need or want it {
    folders/categories
    notes?
}

option to forget recent vaults

options for strength of hashes (and maybe a benchmark for how long it'll take to hash)
options for which encryption method to use

more options for password generation (such as allowed characters and maybe entrophy)

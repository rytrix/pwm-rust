importing very large csv shows updating vault for a long time, maybe buffer the db?

drag drop vaults

is it possible to refactor changed into vault directly instead of in the wrapper?

I don't even know if this in my scope because I don't personally need or want it {
    folders/categories
    notes?
}

I think these things specifically are more user friendly to be good defaults but I will consider upping the hashing strength {
    options for strength of hashes (and maybe a benchmark for how long it'll take to hash)
    options for which encryption method to use
}

more options for password generation (such as allowed characters and maybe entrophy)
maybe just give a warning if the password strength is below an acceptable threshold when creating a vault
